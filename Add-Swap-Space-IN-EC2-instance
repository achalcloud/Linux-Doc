How to Add Swap on AWS EC2 Instance?
First, check if the server has any swap configured on it by using the swapon utility. You can use the -s flag to display a summary of swap usage and availability on your server.
#swapon -s
If nothing is returned, then we can ensure that no swap file exists on the server.

You can also check the swap with the free utility. It shows the overall memory usage of the server.
#free -m
The typical way of allocating space for swap is to use a dedicated partition. However, altering the partition scheme is not always possible due to hardware or software constraints. In this scenario, we can easily create a swap file that resides on the existing partition with the help of dd or fallocate utilities.
Calculate Swap Space Size
The general rule is that the swap space should be equal to 2X the physical RAM, for up to 2 GB of physical RAM, and then an additional 1x physical RAM for any amount above 2 GB. Also, Swap space should never be less than 32 MB.

Amount of system RAM	Recommended swap space
<= 2GB	2x the amount of RAM but never less than 32 MB
> 2GB and < 32GB	4 GB + (RAM â€“ 2 GB)
32 GB of RAM or more	1x the amount of RAM
Check the available storage space of the server:
Use the command df to check the available disk space of the server.

df -h
If the server has enough free disk space, please proceed further.

Create a Swap File
As mentioned earlier, you can use either dd utility or fallocate utility to create the swap file for your server.

Here, I am creating a 2GB Swapfile on the root file system.

Creating swapfile using dd utility:

#dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=2048
Where, bs = block size and count = Number of blocks

Creating swapfile using fallocate utility:

#fallocate --length 2G /swapfile
Next, update the permissions of the created swapfile using chmod command:

#chmod 600 /swapfile
Now, convert that file in to a swap area using mkswap command:

#mkswap /swapfile
Finally enable swap using swapon utility:

#swapon /swapfile
Verify that the procedure was successful:

#swapon -s
Make this swap setting persist by adding following line in /etc/fstab file:

/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0
